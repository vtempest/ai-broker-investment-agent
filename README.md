## 📦 Monorepo Layout

The repo is a [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com) workspace. Every command below can be run
from the repo root, and `turbo` fans it out to the workspaces that define it.

## ☁️ Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

The app runs on Cloudflare Workers via [vinext](https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext) — the Next.js API surface reimplemented as a Vite plugin — with D1 as the database, better-auth for authentication, and Email Workers for transactional email (verification, password reset, invitations).

```bash
# Local dev (vinext dev server; the server runs in workerd, so D1 & email
# bindings from wrangler.jsonc are live)
npm run dev

# Apply drizzle migrations to D1
npm run db:migrate:local    # local miniflare D1
npm run db:migrate:remote   # production D1 (ai-broker-db)

# Preview the production worker locally
npm run preview

# Deploy
npm run deploy
```

Setup notes:

- The build is configured in `apps/ai-broker-web/vite.config.ts` (there is no `next.config`): the `vinext()` plugin holds the Next.js options, and `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` runs the server environment in workerd. `apps/ai-broker-web/worker/index.ts` is the Worker entry — it delegates to vinext's fetch handler and adds the cron `scheduled` handler.
- Bindings are declared in `apps/ai-broker-web/wrangler.jsonc`: `DB` (D1 database `ai-broker-db`), `SEND_EMAIL` (Email Workers), cron triggers for the `/api/cron/*` routes. Read them in server code with `import { env } from "cloudflare:workers"`.
- Page-level ISR is served from the Cloudflare edge cache (`cache: { cdn: cdnAdapter() }` in `vite.config.ts`, `"cache": { "enabled": true }` in `wrangler.jsonc`). Add `data: kvDataAdapter()` and a `VINEXT_KV_CACHE` KV binding if the `"use cache"` data cache is needed.
- Environment variables for the app belong in `apps/ai-broker-web/.env` (vinext reads `.env*` files next to the app, following Next.js precedence). `drizzle.config.ts` additionally falls back to a root `.env`.
- Secrets: `wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (likewise `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `CRON_SECRET`).
- Email Workers is the only mail path — there is no third-party email provider. It requires [Email Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/) to be enabled on the zone, with the `EMAIL_FROM` sender on a verified domain and recipient destination rules configured; without the binding, messages are logged instead of sent so local flows still complete.
- Cloudflare D1 is the only database. On Workers it is the `DB` binding; outside Workers (maintenance scripts, CI, `drizzle-kit`) the same D1 database is reached over its REST API, which needs `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_D1_TOKEN`, and optionally `CLOUDFLARE_DATABASE_ID`. There is no libsql/Turso, Postgres, or local sqlite fallback.
- Workers has no filesystem and no long-lived TCP: server code must reach data through the `DB` binding rather than a TCP database client, and read bundled JSON through an `import` rather than `fs`. Adding either back is what breaks a deploy that builds cleanly.
- Bundle size: the Worker is uploaded compressed and must stay under Cloudflare's 10 MB limit (3 MB on the free plan). The current server bundle is ~7 MB gzipped, so large new dependencies or bundled datasets need checking — `find apps/ai-broker-web/dist/server -name '*.js' -not -path '*/ssr/*' | xargs cat | gzip -9 | wc -c` after a build.
